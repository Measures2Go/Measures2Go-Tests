    The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) was developed to measure balance among older people with
  impairment in balance function by assessing the performance of functional tasks. It is a valid
  instrument used for evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions and for quantitative
  descriptions of function in clinical practice and research. The BBS has been evaluated in several
  reliability studies. A recent study of the BBS, which was completed in Finland, indicates that a change
  of eight (8) BBS points is required to reveal a genuine change in function between two assessments
  among older people who are dependent in ADL and living in residential care facilities.
