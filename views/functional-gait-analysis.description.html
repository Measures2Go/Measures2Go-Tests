    Description
  </div>
  <div class="item item-text-wrap">
      The Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) is a modification of the Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) that uses higher-level tasks to increase the applicability of the test to people with vestibular disorders and to eliminate the ceiling effect of the original test. Three items were added to the DGI because these were noted to be difficult in people with vestibular disorders.
      <br /><br />
      The FGA is used to assess postural stability during various walking tasks.
