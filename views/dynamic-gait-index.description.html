    The Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) was developed as a clinical tool to assess gait, balance and fall risk. It evaluates not only usual steady-state walking, but also walking during more challenging tasks.
    8 functional walking tests are performed by the subject and marked out of three according to the lowest category which applies. 24 is the total individual score possible. Scores of 19 or less have been related to increase incidence of falls.
